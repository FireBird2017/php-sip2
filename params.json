You can find the current stable version under the source tab, or download the current stable code here.\r\n\r\n### Protocol Information\r\nYou may find it helpful to view the 3M SIP2 protocol documentation.  As 3M has sold all of their library solutions to a new vendor, this documentation may be harder to locate than normal.  Try searching google for:  \"SIP2 Protocol Definition\".\r\n\r\n### Donations\r\nFind this project useful? Donate via PayPal\r\n","google":"UA-40062554-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
